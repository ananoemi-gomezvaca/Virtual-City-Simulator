This code originates from the interactive environment available at https://mapscloud.udg.edu/clepsidra, 
developed within the framework of the CLEPSIDRA project and based on the methodological foundations of the authors 
(Gomez Vaca, A. N., Popartan, L. A., Nuss-Girona, S., & Rodríguez-Roda, I.). 
The platform focuses on the construction of composite indicators and the assessment of vulnerability 
using multicriteria decision-making methodologies.

The code is released under the MIT License, making it freely available for use, modification, and adaptation. 
It may be applied following the original CLEPSIDRA approach or extended to new thematic areas requiring:

- the implementation of multicriteria decision-analysis (MCDA) methods,

- the design and aggregation of indicators,

- the development of composite indices for vulnerability, risk, sustainability, or other analytical purposes,

- or the integration of MCDA workflows into interactive tools or decision-support systems.

Users are encouraged to acknowledge the original source by referencing the CLEPSIDRA project,
